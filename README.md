# Assignment-01

The goal of this assignment is:
<br>
- To demonstrate your understanding of clustering algorithms like K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical and Spectral. (This gives you practice for future data challenges.) <br>
- To develop your version K-Means using the algorithm specified below. (This is a typical interview question in machine learning.) <br>
- To extend the functionality of the developed K-means implementation through additional parameters. (This shows your ability to develop novel or custom algorithms.)<br>
- Comparison of performance between K-Means on dataset used in Lab 02 and your version.<br>
